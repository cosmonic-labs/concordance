# Bank Account Example - Domain Model
The domain model for the bank account example has been modeled as simple Rust structures to help illustrate the separation of concerns between the Concordance event sourcing engine and the bank account example.

Here rather than using an IDL to define an interface and code generation, we've just created a shared library that contains the "business model" for the banking sample.
