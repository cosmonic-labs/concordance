# Shape Rules
# While there may be multiple logical ways to declare relationships, the following
# is the mandatory way to describe relationships such that the documentation and code
# generation tools can accurately process the specification.
#
# command -> in -> aggregate
# aggregate -> out -> event
# event -> in -> projector
# event -> in -> process-manager
# pm -> out -> event
# (entity) -> doc -> "..."
# (entity) -> desc -> "..."
# (entity) -> spec -> "..."
#
# The name of each entity is value of the node ID minus its URI prefix
