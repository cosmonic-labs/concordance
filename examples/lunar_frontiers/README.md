This Concordance sample illustrates a number of extremely powerful concepts. First and foremost, this sample is designed to allow developers to roll up their sleeves and play with **DDIL** (_Degraded, Disconnected, Intermittent, Limited Bandwidth_) networks. This is a very common scenario for many products, and we want to make sure that Concordance is a great platform for building applications that work in these environments.
