# Concordance Examples
This directory contains a number of examples and reference applications that illustrate how to build, deploy, and manage Concordance-based applications.

## Example List
The following is a list of example applications:

* **[Bank Account](./bankaccount)** - A simple banking example that illustrates aggregates, process managers, gateways, and projectors.
* **[Lunar Frontiers](./lunar_frontiers/)** - An example application illustrating the use of multiple components designed to reside in locations that have intermittent, degraded, or no network connectivity. The sample domain model is that of a mothership invading a solar system by launching autonomous rovers.
